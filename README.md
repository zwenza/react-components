a collection of easy to use components. 
The framework builds on top of blueprintjs and simplifies many things 
in blueprintjs to getting started faster and build great application.

This also contains some additional components that are not available in blueprintjs

## usage

## development
`react-components` isn't available on npm because it's still in a very early development phase.
if you still want to test the framework or contribute to it you can checkout the project and run
`npm install` first. 

To publish your changes local run `npm run dev`. 
Now you can link the libary into your sample with `npm link react-components`.
