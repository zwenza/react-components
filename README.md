# react-components [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zwenza/react-components.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zwenza/react-components)
a collection of easy to use components. 

The framework builds on top of react-bootstrap and provides many components you then won't
need to implement on your own to getting started faster and build great applications.

## usage
see the wiki on which components are available and how to use them!

## development
`react-components` isn't available on npm because it's still in a very early development phase.
if you still want to test the framework or contribute to it you can checkout the project and run
`npm install` first. 

To publish your changes local run `npm run dev`. 
Now you can link the libary into your sample with `npm link react-components`.

### styling 
react-components uses bootstrap for styling to make it easy to create your own styles.

You must add the bootstrap css into your html:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/latest/css/bootstrap.min.css">`
